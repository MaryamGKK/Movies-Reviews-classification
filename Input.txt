This show was hilarious. I loved Jon Lovitz and all the other voice actors.
Jay Sherman is such a comically brilliant character. As a film buff, I thought the movie parodies in the show "Coming Attractions" were amazing. 
I also liked the shows send up on the entertainment industry and films and actors in general I think Al Jean and Mike Reiss did an excellent job with this series. 
Sadly, most Simpsons personnel don't get as lucky with their own projects, even Groening had problems keeping Futurama on the air, which I also loved. 
I still can't believe it only lasted two seasons. I think it would be awesome if someday they would come out with more episodes or even a feature film.
